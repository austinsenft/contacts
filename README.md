# Built With
Tailwind CSS 
Python, Flask for backend 
Javascript, React for frontend  

# Features Implemented: 
Modal / popup window for form entry <br>
Coniditonal rendering of buttons <br>
Logic to prevent empty entries in forms as well as checking for an '@' in email address <br> 
This was also a chance to code on Widows instead of Mac as I usually do. So some commands may be different per operating system <br>
